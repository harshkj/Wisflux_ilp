1. What is JavaScript?
Ans JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, that is commonly used to create dynamic and interactive web content.

2. What is the difference between b/w let and var?
Ans var has function-level scope, meaning that variables declared with var are accessible throughout the entire function
they are declared in, including any nested functions. On the other hand, let has block-level scope, meaning that
variables declared with let are only accessible within the block they are declared in

3.Why do we prefer const over var?
Ans const creates a variable that cannot be reassigned to a new value, making it immutable. This can help prevent bugs
that can arise from accidentally reassigning a variable.

4.What is the use of javascript in web browsers?
Ans JavaScript in web browsers are used for DOM manipulation,Form validation,Event handling,Asynchronous
requests,Animation and visual effects

5.What are objects?
Ans An object is a collection of properties that describe a specific entity or concept.

6.What is an array and how is it different from an Object in Javascript?
Ans.An array is a special type of object that stores an ordered list of values. An array is similar to an object in that
it can contain properties and methods, but it has some key differences:It is Ordered ,Index-based,has Length
property,has built in Array methods

7.What is a function ?
Ans.A Function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or invoked from other parts of a
program. Functions can take inputs (called arguments) and return outputs.

8.How can we implement call by value and call by reference in Javascript ?
Ans.Call by value means that a copy of the value is passed to the function, and any changes made to the copy do not
affect the original value.Call by reference means that the function receives a reference to the original object or
array, and any changes made to the object or array within the function affect the original object or array.In
JavaScript, all primitive types, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, are passed by value, while objects and arrays
are passed by reference.

9.What are the primitive data types in Javascript?
Ans.Primitive data types are immutable, which means that their values cannot be changed once they are created. However,
variables that store primitive values can be reassigned to new values.In JavaScript, there are six primitive data types:
number,string,boolean,null,undefined,symbol.

10.What is DOM?
Ans DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents,The DOM is a platform- and
language-neutral standard that can be used with any programming language, but it is most commonly used with JavaScript
in web development.

11 Why we need DOM?
Ans Manipulation of web page content,Access to web page elements,Dynamic styling,Cross-browser compatibility.


1. Average of array nums in Javascript?

    const nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    const sum = nums.reduce((total, num) => total + num);
    const avg = sum / nums.length;
    console.log(avg); // Output: 30

2. Swap two numbers by reference?
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    console.log(`Before swap: a = ${a}, b = ${b}`);

    [a, b] = [b, a];
    console.log(`After swap: a = ${a}, b = ${b}`);

3. Print the fibonacci sequence?
    function fibonacciSeries(n) {
        let fib = [0, 1];
        
        for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
        }

        return fib;
    }
    console.log(fibonacciSeries(10)); 
  
4. Sort an array by both ascending and descending order? 
    const nums = [5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1];

    const asc = nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    console.log(asc); 

    const desc = nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    console.log(desc); 

5. Show a variable value in an HTML webpage using DOM?

  <script>
    const name = "Harsh";
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Hello, " + name + "!";
  </script>
